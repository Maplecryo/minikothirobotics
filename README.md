# There's no bathroom for me here.
There is no bathroom. There are no colored bathrooms in this building. Or
any building outside the West Campus, which is half a mile away. Did you
know that? I have to walk to Timbuktu just to relieve myself. And I can't use
one of the handy bikes. Picture that, Mr. Harrison. My uniform. Skirt below
my knees, my heels, and a simple string of pearls. Well, I don't own pearls.
Lord knows you don't pay coloreds enough to afford pearls! And I work like
a dog, day and night, living off of coffee from a pot none of you wanna
touch. So, excuse me if I have to go to the restroom a few times a day.
